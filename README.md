### Lighthouse Labs Week 2 Day 3 Assignments

##### The purpose of this assignment is to create an app that fetches data from an external service using AJAX with jQuery.

The end product is a weather app that fetches data using Weather Underground's JSON API. It has the ability to search for a list of cities by partially typing in the name in the text field. Using Weather Underground's autocomplete API, it will then display all city names that match the search string. 

Once the user clicks on a city, it will again fetch and display the weather information for that particular city. The background image of the site will also change based on the current weather of the selected city.
